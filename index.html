# Fast tests for apps that use Rails
(using Test-First programming)

# Test-First, comes from XP...
# XP values are **Comunication**, **Simplicity**, **Feeback**, **Courage** and **Respect**.

```ruby
my_values.include?(xp_values) ? :continue : :exit
```

# Test-First, is **writing a failing automated test before changing any code**.

## And addresses many problems at once...

---

class: middle

# Scope creep

## No more **just in case** code, if you need to put that other code in, write another test after you've made this one work.

---

class: middle

# Coupling and cohesion

## If it's hard to write a test, it's a signal that you have a design problem. **Loosely coupled, highly cohesive code is easy to test**.

---

class: middle

# Trust

## It's hard to trust the author of code that doesn't work. **Writing clean code that works and demonstrating your intentions** with automated tests, give your teammates a reason to trust you.

---

class: middle

# Rhythm

## It's easy to get lost for hours when you are coding. When programming test-first, it's clear what to do next: **either write another test or make the broken test work**. Soon this develops into a netural and efficient rhythm...

### test, code, refactor, test, code, refactor...

# Incomming Messages

```ruby
describe "Book store" do
  it "has books" do
    store = BookStore.new(books: ["Principito"])

    # Query -> Assert result
    expect(store.books).to eq ["Principito"]
  end

  it "can receive books" do
    store = BookStore.new(books: ["Principito"])

    # Command -> Assert direct public side effects
    store.add_book("Rayuela")
    expect(store.books).to eq ["Principito", "Rayuela"]

# Rails

class: middle, center

# We are not building Rails Apps **we are building apps that use Rails**.

[rails] -> [App]  vs [rails App]

---

class: middle

# We want to test our code not the rails code <small class="text-muted">(that's integration tests job)</small>

### As an example in my last project we have, **1174 unit** tests and **150 integration** tests.

---

class: middle, center

# Why?

---

class: middle

# Because we want to make sure that our system works every minute or maybe less...

```terminal
Finished in 16 minutes # => =(
```

```terminal
Finished in 1.5 seconds # => =)
```

---

class: middle

# Becuase we want to be able to make changes without breaking the system and do incremental design

---

class: middle, center

# Why?

---

class: middle, center

# Because there is no perfect design!

---

class: middle, center

# Mmmm... but how I start using this in my App?

---

class: middle, center

# Write POROs (Plain old ruby objects)
<span class="text-muted">Thats all?</span>

---

class: middle

# Define the boundaries of your system

### maybe... Database (ActiveRecord), Payment Gateways, File system...

---

class: middle

# Start using just Incoming Query messages in Modules

* Define **functions** without side effects... just receive something and return something
* Don't keep state
* Don't define the boundaries, just build the needed data.

# With this approach you are not testing te interaction just the values that your app produce.

## Try to use this technique as much as you can...

---

class: middle

# But if the complexity is in the interaction or you think that you are not testing enough

### Compute -> External Service -> Complex Function -> File system -> Database

---

class: middle

# Now you can introduce Outgoing Command Messages

### Use this to test **what you are sending to the boundaries** of the system or to **other objects that computes complex things**
